# Dotfiles for my Windows PC

I have multiple Windows PCs. These files help configure them so that they all operate the same way (at least for bash).

I pulled the contents of this directory from all over the internet. I try to refer to the resources that I used whenever I can.

To download:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/windows-dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
 ```

To install:
```bash
sh ~/.dotfiles/link.sh
cat ~/.dotfiles/append-to-bashrc.txt >> ~/.bashrc
```
